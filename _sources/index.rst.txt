About SMiPoly  
==========================

"SMiPoly (\ **S**\ mall **M**\ olecules **i**\ nto **Poly**\ mers)" is rule-based virtual library generator for discovery of functional polymers. It is consist of two submodules, "monc.py" and "polg.py".  
"monc.py" is a monomer classifier from a list of small molecules, and "polg.py" is a polymer repeating unit generator from the classified monomer list.
